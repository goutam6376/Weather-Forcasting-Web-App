## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
- **Deployment Type**: Static file hosting (suitable for GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- **Build Process**: No build step required - direct file serving
- **Files Required**: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support

### GitHub Pages Deployment
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Upload the three main files
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Select main branch and root folder
5. Access your live site at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

### Performance Considerations
- **Caching**: Static assets can be cached indefinitely
- **Loading**: Single-page application with fast initial load
- **Offline Capability**: Works offline once initial files are cached
